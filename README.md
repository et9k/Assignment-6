3. Discuss any interesting observations you find from the results
   Generally, it looks like the forward sequences have better motif matching scores.  The reverse complement sequences do have positive scores sometimes, though.  Sequences 7, 8, and 11 are examples of the reverse complement achieving the highest score.  The top scoring motifs from forward and reverse complement sequences generally don't overlap, which is expected. However, sequence 4 (chr14:57485698-57485998) does show the top 2 scoring sequences are the forward and reverse complement sequences next to each other.
